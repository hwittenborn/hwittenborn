Hey :wave:! This is my GitHub profile, where I host all of the open-source projects I work on.

The main things I currently surround myself with include Linux, programming in Rust, Debian packaging, and maintaining various servers I use on a daily basis :zap:.

Currently my main focuses :technologist: are [Celeste](https://github.com/hwittenborn/celeste) and [makedeb](https://github.com/makedeb), though I'm often trying new things to see if I can find something that'll keep my curiosity going :nerd_face:.

You can join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FtNhPepvj7), where I regularly talk :open_mouth: about stuff related to my projects and all the other random stuff that comes to mind :bulb:.

I can be contacted via the email listed on my GitHub profile, as well as via any of the methods listed on my website, linked above.
