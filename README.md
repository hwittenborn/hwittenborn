Hey :wave:! This is my GitHub profile, where I host all of the open-source projects I work on.

The main things I currently surround myself with include Linux, programming in Rust, Debian packaging, and maintaining various servers I use on a daily basis :zap:.

Currently my main focuses :technologist: are [makedeb](/makedeb) and [Celeste](/hwittenborn/celeste), though I'm often trying new things to see if I can find something that'll keep my curiosity going :bulb:.

I'm currently looking for a job :memo: if you'd like to consider me to be part of your company. You can find my full skillset and resume :spiral_notepad: on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hwittenborn/), and if you'd just like to learn more about me too, you can find all of that information over on my [website](https://hunterwittenborn.com) :globe_with_meridians:.

I can be contacted via the email listed on my GitHub profile, as well as via any of the methods listed on my website, linked above.
